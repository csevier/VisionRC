Features for v1
=============
Pre-configured window layouts for selection. Well better layouting in general at start.
dynamic screen resolution for app itself. (its currently hardcoded at 1920x 1080, this wont fly)
better visualize sample color when hovering mouse for color select
Improve all audio. (ie maybe reconsider my voice on the states? How does this effect localization?)
polygon zones over squares

Bugs  CRITICAL, CANT SHIP WITHOUT FIX.
=============
deleted racers need their masks deleted as well
Dont usem v4l2 camera backend, needs to be cross plat.
Recording isnt working on remote camera? (should i remove remote cam?)
Test all conditions many times with many racers.
Auto exposure is lowering framerates, which is expected, but, not highering framerates back when disabled.

Features v2 or bugs?
===========
Allow editable track times for error correct.* (perhaps add a button that manually stamps a lap for a racer when in offline mode? Maybe this is not possible.)
   - I have some ideas on how to make this possible in offline mode. Use a mark start/end appraoch.
    Allow a button to make 2 marks. and then allow right click on lap section to click "fix".
