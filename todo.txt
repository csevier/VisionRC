Features for v1
=============
Post race visualization graphs.
Pre-configured layouts for selection. Well better layouting in general at start.
dynamic screen resolution for app itself.
Allow editable track times for error correct.* (perhaps add a button that manually stamps a lap for a racer when in offline mode?)
Improve all audio. (ie maybe reconsider my voice on the states?)
Race Durations with state for racers to finish after the race ended.
Allow resolution adjustment for camera. (should i do this?)
Point to point race support with zones.
allow racer name changes.
should race states be manually changeable Instead of wizard style?
update export with section info

Bugs  CRITICAL, CANT SHIP WITHOUT FIX.
=============
deleted racers need their masks deleted as well
Dont usem v4l2 camera backend, needs to be cross plat.
Dont assume resolutions!
Video playback in offline mode is suppose to match framerate but is slower then actual time.?!?!?s
    -- Okay but the times were DEAD accurate, i wonder if its my own timing math on the video and not on frames.
Recording isnt working on remote camera? (should i remove remote cam?)
convert to as close to a c api as possible?
