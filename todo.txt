Features for v1
=============
Post race visualization graphs.
Pre-configured layouts for selection. Well better layouting in general at start.
dynamic screen resolution for app itself.
Allow editable track times for error correct.* (perhaps add a button that manually stamps a lap for a racer when in offline mode?)
Improve all audio. (ie maybe reconsider my voice on the states? How does this effect localization?)
polygon zones over squares

Bugs  CRITICAL, CANT SHIP WITHOUT FIX.
=============
deleted racers need their masks deleted as well
Dont usem v4l2 camera backend, needs to be cross plat.
Video playback in offline mode is suppose to match framerate but is slower then actual time.?!?!?s
    -- Okay but the times were DEAD accurate, i wonder if its my own timing math on the video and not on frames.
Recording isnt working on remote camera? (should i remove remote cam?)
convert to as close to a c api as possible?
Test all conditions many times with many racers.
Auto exposure is lowering framerates, which is expected, but, not highering framerates back when disabled.
