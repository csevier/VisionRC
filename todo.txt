Features for v1
=============

Pre-configured layouts for selection. Well better layouting in general at start.

Improve all audio.
Race Durations with state for racers to finish after the race ended.
Allow resolution adjustment for camera.
Multiple cams at once support
Point to point race support with zones.

Bugs  CRITICAL, CANT SHIP WITHOUT FIX.
=============
Dont usem v4l2 camera backend, needs to be cross plat.
App crashes when more then 2 check in cars have multiple overlaps. Fix it.
Dont assume resolutions!
Video playback in offline mode is suppose to match framerate but is slower then actual time.?!?!?s
    -- Okay but the times were DEAD accurate, i wonder if its my own timing math on the video and not on frames.
Recording isnt working on remote camera?
